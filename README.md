# Lynch Lab Scripts

Developed by Katie McCauley

These are the lab-level scripts that are currently written. They have been sectioned off into the types of analyses you might do, so community composition scripts are in the `BetaDiversity` directory; methods to look for significant taxa are in the `SigTaxa` directory.

Information will also be posted to AirTable as well.
